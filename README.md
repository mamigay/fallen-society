# Fallen Society
Society has fallen. Every structure of order has been burned in the nuclear fire. It is up to you to rebuild society in the Commonwealth and keep your dignity as well as your sanity in tact. Are you up for the task?

**You can download the list via Wabbajack** (Show NSFW, Show unofficial lists)

***

# Before you start
Please read carefully and check every requirement here:

## Hardware requirements
I have a decent setup at home with the following specs:
- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700K CPU
- RAM: 96GB DDR4
- GPU: NVidia RTX 3080 (12GB VRAM)

So that should give you an idea of what you need (except for the RAM maybe. 32GB should be more than enough).

I play at 4k resolution (3840 x 2160) and have constant 60FPS in most areas. Of course there are some drops here and there but nothing major and nothing below 40FPS for more than a second. The list should be very performant.

You should have at least ```180 GB``` of free space on an SSD (better -> m.2 SSD) for the installation and an additional ```80 GB``` for the downloads. So you would need to have around ```260 GB``` of free space. If you insist on installing this list on an HDD, than prepare yourself for painfull and hard installation! You are warned.

## Accounts
You need the following accounts to download this list:
- Nexus Premium Account (you can use free, but it would take ages)
- LoversLab Account
- Moddingham Account (needed for the lates AAF version)

## DLC & Creation Club Content
You need all Fallout 4 DLC except for the official HD texture pack. **DON'T INSTALL IT!**
Creation Club content is and will not be supported.

***

# Installation
At this point you should have read everything that came before und didn't skip anything. The next section requires a lot of attention so read carefully.

## Preparation

### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages
This is hard requirement for MO2 to operate. You may already have it installed, if not, download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019) here:
[Download Visual C++ Redistributable Package.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

### Page file setup
Fallout 4 modlists need a large amount of memory purely because of the amount of *stuff* in them - especially modlists on the larger side or with a lot going on. For the best experience, you should setup a pagefile of at least **20GB** - yes, even if you have a million GB of RAM. To setup your pagefile;

1. Hold down the *LEFT* Windows key and press **R**
2. Type in `systempropertiesadvanced` in the run box and then press ENTER
3. Under the "Performance" option, click the "Settings..." button
4. Switch to the "Advanced" tab
5. Under "Virtual Memory", click the "Change..." button
6. Uncheck `Automatically manage...` if it's checked
7. Select your *fastest* SSD in the list of drives
8. Check "Custom Size"
9. Set `Initial Size` to 20480
10. Set `Maximum Size` to 20480 also
    1.  *Note: you can set this up to 40000 if you have the space, this will let the pagefile expand to as large as 40GB*
11. Press the "Set" button
12. Press OK
13. Press APPLY and then OK
14. Restart your PC to apply the pagefile setting

### Setup your Shader Cache
Driver defaults from Nvidia and AMD for shader cache size is limited to 4GB. Being this small can lead to rare crashes in heavily modified Fallout 4 installs. Increasing the shader cache size is done via the Nvidia Control Panel (I assume the same for AMD users is true also but I don't have AMD hardware to check with). 

*These instructions are Nvidia specific as it is the hardware I have.*

1. Open the NVidia Control Panel
2. Head to `Manage 3D Settings`
3. Scroll down in `Global Settings` to find the `Shader Cache Size` option
4. Set the Shader Cache to *at least* 10GB
5. Done

![Shader Cache](img/ShaderCache.png)


### Setup your VSYNC
For the enb and highFPS fix to work properly, you need to setup your VSYNC in your GPU driver settings as follows:

*These instructions are Nvidia specific as it is the hardware I have.*

1. Open the NVidia Control Panel
2. Head to `Manage 3D Settings`
3. Scroll down in `Vertical sync` to find the `Use 3D application setting` option and activate it
4. Done

![VSYNC](img/vsync.png)

### Disable Steam Overlay
The Steam overlay is known to cause issues when using ENBs. I recommend you turn it off to be sure that it doesn't interfere in any way and you can do so by heading into Steam, right clicking on Fallout 4 in your game library and clicking **Properties** > **General** > **Deselect "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game"**.

### Set game language to English
Wabbajack and some/most of the modding tools out there only support English language versions of games. Setting the language to English in Steam will stop issues like Wabbajack file verification failures when installing. As with disabling the overlay, right click on Fallout 4 in your game library and click **Properties** > **Language** > **Select English**.

### Change Steam's Updating Behavior
If for some reason Bethesda decide to release an update for Fallout 4, everything will probably break. Well, not *everything* but something will definitely break until mods can be updated to suit. To stop this from happening, you need to tell Steam that you only want to update when you tell it to. You can do this by right clicking on Fallout 4 in your game library and clicking **Properties** > **Updates** > **Change Automatic Updates to "Only update this game when I launch it"**. Whilst you're in here, it's also recommended to disable Steam Cloud too.

### Clean current Fallout 4 installation
If you have not yet installed Fallout 4, you can skip this part.

1. Right click on Fallout 4 in your game library and click **Properties** > **Local Files** > **Browse**. 
2. Uninstall the game via Steam - right click on Fallout 4 in your game library and click **Manage** > **Uninstall**.
3. Check the explorer window for any left over files - if there are any, delete them.
4. Open Windows start menu/search and type in `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.
5. Delete the Fallout 4 folder.
6. Head to `Documents\My Games` and delete the Fallout 4 folder.

### Install Fallout 4
Once you've done the steps above, you can now set Steam to download Fallout 4 again but ***do not*** install Fallout 4 to a protected folder, such as `Desktop`, `Downloads` or `Program Files` of any kind. It's best to create a new, dedicated folder for it using the Steam Library function somewhere on the root of your drive such as `C:\SteamLibrary`. A lot of people have a dedicated secondary drive for their games, keeping the OS install separate; using this secondary drive will also work.

### Start Fallout 4
That's right - start the game. You need to let the game do its initial start up jobs such as creating registry entries and generating default config files. Once you've gotten to the main menu you can close the game again.

## Wabbajack
Installing the list is straight forward, Wabbajack will do most of the heavy lifting for you - you only have to tell it where to put stuff.

Set the installation location to a folder on the root of a drive, something like `C:\FallenSociety`. Do not install it to one of the protected folders as mentioned earlier. The download location will have likely been filled in for you too - ensure it matches the directory you set for the installation location, or if you have multiple Fallout 4 modlists installed, use a common download folder - this will stop you from having to redownload common mods across multiple modlists. 

Before you hit **GO**, a quick tip:

*To get the best performance with Wabbajack, it is recommended that you have the install folder for Wabbajack, the modlist folder and the downloads folder on an SSD; ideally the same SSD.* After the installation is complete, you can move the downloads folder to a storage HDD or other storage medium to save space on your game installation drive. It's not recommended to allow your drive to exceed 90% of its storage space used - Windows Explorer will show a red bar under your drive if you do go over 90% so you need to be sure that you have enough space on your installation drive so that you won't exceed this 90% storage level.

Once you have everything set in Wabbajack, hit **GO** and let it do its thing. It might take a while as there is a fair bit to download and the speed of this will depend on your internet performance as well as your CPU in the later stages for hashing and unpacking the downloads.

# Commonly Failing Downloads
If, for some reason, a download just won't work, check this out: [Failing Downloads](https://github.com/Nymano641/fallen-society/wiki/Commonly-Failing-Downloads)

# Post Installation
If you made it this far, chances are good you will make it to the end.

## Mod Organizer 2
Once everything is downloaded and you closed Wabbajack, head to the installation folder an run ModOrganizer2.exe.

**VERY IMPORTANT: DON'T RUN LOOT! THE LOADORDER IS EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD.**

## Stock Game
Fallen Society utilises the stock game feature offered by Wabbajack, meaning that Wabbajack will make a local copy of your Fallout 4 game files during the installation process. This means that your Steam installation of Fallout 4 is completely untouched, even by files that go in the game folder such as ENB files.

## Create Desktop Shortcut
Open MO2 and click on shortcut in the top right corner -> click desktop.

![Dekstop](img/DesktopIcon.png)

***

# Starting Your Game
If everything is done, you can begin your journey into the wasteland. Read carefully!

## Step One
When you press New Game in the main menu you will be immediatly greeted with an pop-ip. This is from the Hardship mod. Just click okay and forget. After the intro video the Cheat Terminal pop-up will occur. Do the same, just click and forget.

## Step Two
Now you will be greeted with these two pop-ups (see images below). Choose your sexual preferences and traits. On the second page, click finish **after** you choose everything to your liking.

![Choose Sexual Preference](img/setup3.png)
Just choose one.

![Choose Sexual Preference 2](img/setup4.png)
Check every menu **before** hitting that finish button!

## Step Three
After that is done, just create your character. **NOTE:** This modlist configured for female characters. Male characters are not supported for now. If you choose to play as a male, you are on your own.

## Step Four
After you create your character and hit that "done" button, **DO NOTHING!!!** Just wait until the AAF pop-ups appear. Just click okay and then wait until the messages in the top left corner stop appearing.

## Step Five
After the mod messages have dissappeared and only then you may proceed to through the bathroom door. Here you can choose what to do. 

**WARNING:** I have never tested the vanilla start with this list and I never will, but im pretty sure it will break the game. So please choose the "It's only a dream..." option and start in the wasteland. Also better for roleplaying.

## Step Six
After you wake up in the wasteland you will be greeted with the next pop-up. Yeah :D

![Gas Masks](img/setup8.png)
Choose the preset of your liking, but be aware that it is possible to die from a radiation storm. If you want to be safe, open the console and type tgm to be invincible for the short period until the weather loads. Just click for the next gas mask pop-ups.

## Step Seven
Now wait again. Some messages will pop-up on the top left and the weather might change drastically after a few seconds. All part of the plan.

![Backpacks](img/setup9.png)
When this turns up, just take it and choose the spawnrate to your liking.

## Step Eight
Now you are good to open the Mod Configuration Menu. Hit esc and open **Mod Configuration**

![MCM Settings](img/setup10.png)
Wait for a bit until the menu is fully loaded. There is some flickering going on before it finishes. Now click apply and wait again for a few seconds. When it seems like nothing more is happening, close the MCM.

![Success](img/setup11.png)

If everything worked out, you should see these messages in the top left.

## Step Nine
Almost done, I swear ;) 

Now we need to make some manual changes. Open the MCM again and head to Immersion -> Fallout 2287 - Gas Masks of the Wasteland:

![Gas Masks](img/setup12.png)
The MCM doesn't safe these settings for some reaseon. So you can choose what you like here. I recommend a longer filter duration and the auto replacer feature. That makes the gas mask gameplay a lot easier.

Now head over to Immersion -> Advanced Needs 76. We need to manually activate the needs and the bathroom system.

![Needs](img/setup13.png)
Click the button where it says: Click here to Enable Advanced Needs. 

**IMPORTANT:** You can change some of these settings to your liking, but never activate the gas mask system!

![Bathroom](img/setup14.png)
Here you can also pick and choose. Click the button where it says: Click here to Enable Bathroom Needs. 

**OPTIONAL** You can go to the "Hygiene Systems" tab and enable the menstrual cycle and link to FPE. This enables a link to Family Planning Enhanced.

**NOTES ABOUT THE ADVANCED NEEDS 76 MOD:** You can alter some of that stuff that is going on, but stuff like dirtiness is better handled by Get Dirty. For maximum compatibility just use my settings and nothing else. You can alos decide to not use the needs and bathroom settings at all. This is just for survival aspects and immersion.

Now close the MCM and wait for the Advanced Needs pop-up to appeard and click ok.

Lastly, head back into the MCM and go to AAF NSFW -> Provocative Perks.

![Provocative Perks](img/setup15.png)
Click the button and close the MCM. You can now choose some special perks. Read carefully and take your time. When you are finished, just click on finish selection process. 

**NOTE:** These perks are meant to permanent so choose wisely ;)

## Last Step
I swear :P You are technically good to go. Only two mods will interfere with your journey now.

**Beantown Interiors:** Two pop-ups about the holotapes (sometimes just one for some reason). Just click okay.

## FOV
To change your FOV, open up the MCM and navigate to Gameplay Tweaks/Custom Camera. There is everything you need. Also don't forget to save your profile.

# Ultrawide Support
I don't own a ultrawidescreen. So there is not really a support here, but you can enable the plugin in the image below and put the esp to priority 201 (MO2 plugins plane) and see how it goes. Feel free to give feedback or tipps if you already have a tested setup for this.

![Ultrawide](img/ultrawide.png)

# AMD Users
This list is tested and developed on an NVidia system. So let me know if something doesn't work as intended.

There is an NVidia specific category in the MO2 left pane. You can disable the NVidia tools, but my guess is, that they just won't have any effect on your system. That said, there might be a significant performance drop, because of the absence of NVidia Reflex. Please let me know how it plays on AMD systems.

***
# Keyboard Layout
You can find the keyboard layout in the Mod Configuration Menu -> Hotkey Manager. There you will also be able to change the keybindings to you likings.

# Thanks
I would like to thanks some people for their work and inspiration.

First of all a special thanks to the fantastic ForgottenGlory who brought me back to modding Bethesda games (without his knowledge of course :D)

Special thanks as well to iAmMe27 for his fantastic modlist Wasteland of Depravity. Check it out ;) Also I stole a lot of text from his readme for this modlist :D sorry mate^^ Check him out [here](https://github.com/iAmMe27/WoD)

***

# Updating The Modlist
When a new update is released, please check the [changelog](https://github.com/Nymano641/fallen-society/blob/main/changelog.md) first. You may not need to update your modlist but if there is anything that resolves game breaking issues, it'll be noted in the changelog. Backup your saves before you commit to any updates, Wabbajack doesn't usually touch save files, it does has the ability to delete them if it wanted to.

If you have added anything to this modlist at all, Wabbajack will also delete those. You should know how to stop it from doing this if you're going to add stuff to modlists but if you don't, you have to prepend your mod name with [NoDelete] - this will make Wabbajack ignore these files. You will need to reinstall these mods and re-sort their load order after an update though, so I hope you kept backup information on where they went in the load order!

All that aside, updates are basically the same as an installation except you have to ensure that you have the "Overwrite" checkbox ticked in Wabbajack.

***

# Uninstall
Nothing needed. Just delete the Fallen Society and everything is gone. You installation isn't touched at all.
